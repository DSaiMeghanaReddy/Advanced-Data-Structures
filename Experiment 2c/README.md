#   Experiment 2
## Aim of the experiment - Write a program for implementing the following sorting methods:
  c)Quick sort

###  procedure for the experiment
The Quicksort algorithm picks an element as pivot and partition the given array around the selected pivot element. 
There are many ways the pivot element can be selected. Those are:-
Always pick the first element as a pivot.
Always pick the last element as pivot.
Pick random element as pivot.
Pick the middle element or median as a pivot.
After choosing the pivot element, the algorithm rearranges in such a way that all the elements which are smaller than selected pivot element shifts to the left side of pivot element and all the elements which are greater than the selected pivot element shifts to the right side of pivot element. 
At last, the algorithm recursively sorts the subarrays on the left and right side of pivot element.
