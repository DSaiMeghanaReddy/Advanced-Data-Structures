#   Experiment 8c
## Aim of the experiment - Write a program to perform the following operations:
8c)Search for a key element in a Red-Black tree


###  procedure for the experiment 
As every red-black tree is a special case of a binary tree so the searching algorithm of a red-black tree is similar to that of a binary tree.
Start from the root.
Compare the inserting element with root, if less than root, then recurse for left, else recurse for right.
If the element to search is found anywhere, return element found, else return element not found.
