#   Experiment 7c
## Aim of the experiment - Write a program to perform the following operations:
7c)search for a element from AVL tree


###  procedure for the experiment 
Searching for a node in an AVL Tree is the same as with any BST.
Start from the root of the tree and compare the key with the value of the node. If the key equals the value, return the node. If the key is greater, search from the right child, otherwise continue the search from the left child.
The time complexity of the search is a function of the height. We can assume that time complexity in the worst case is O(log(N)).
